# How to create VM Template with Proxmox 8.x

Lastly, I build a lab machine where I installed Proxmox. It's based on a second hand Dell Optiplex 7040 Mini with an i7 6700t processor.
The case is really small and silent but have enough performance to host several virtual machines in parallele.
I use it to experiment some prototypes I need to build.
